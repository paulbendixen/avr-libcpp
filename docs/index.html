				<P>
				This is an attempt to use C++ in an AVR compiler.
				</P>
				<P>
				The way this is attempted is to use the newlib as an inspiration and
				to use the experiences I've had implementing C++ for microcontrollers.
				</P>
				<P>
				This means using the layout and most of the methods from the newlib
				library, which in turns determines my license, and implement it in
				a way that is compatible with the philosophy of the project.
				</P>

					Philosophy
				</H2>
				<P>
				Since this is a library designed for very small microcontrollers the
				usual ideal of no dynamic memory allocation and no exceptions are followed.
				</P>
				<P>
				I realise that there are some uses for both in microcontroller coding
				but this design decision is the one I'm going with.
