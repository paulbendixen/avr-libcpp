				In order to make a standard library some decisions must be made, this pages describes the ones taken for this project.
				<H2>Decisions</H2>
				<P>
				The library should follow the standard as much as possible, given the philosophy. This means that some deviations
				may occur since there are some ways in which other standard libraries are implemented for ease of use.
				</P>
				<P>
				One way in which this might be seen is in the use of the named length types uintXX_t. These are all placed in the 
				std namespace.
